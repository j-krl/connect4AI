# Python-Connect-4
A simple command-line version of the game "Connect Four."

A game for 2 players on a 7x6 grid game board. 

Players take turns dropping their game piece onto the grid by picking a column number 1-7 (inclusive).

The game pieces fall to the lowest position available on the grid for the column they selected.

The first player to reach 4 pieces aligned in a row, wins. Rows can be any direction: horizontal, vertical, 
diagonal up, diagonal down.

Choosing a column off the game board grid will prompt the player to re-pick.
